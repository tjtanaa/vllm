# Basic Examples

Quick-start scripts for experimenting with vLLM-omni.

## Scripts

- `text_generation.py` – Minimal standalone usage showing how to create an LLM and generate text locally.
- `api_client.py` – Demonstrates calling the FastAPI `/generate` endpoint from Python.

Run any script with `python examples/basic/<script>.py`. Ensure the `vllm_omni` conda environment is active and dependencies are installed.
